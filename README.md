-Playwright.config file  : Aiding in cross-browser testing & managing our environments & configurations
-Test Folder             : Used to organize our tests (Smoke, regression, end-to-end, API and backend)
-Page Object Model (POM) : Design pattern, which centralizes page-related locators and methods within the folder
-Playwright Fixtures     : Along with the (POM), enabling us to develop custom fixtures for our test file.

-Built-In-Reports        : Playwright generates built in detailed HTML, JSON, or JUnit reports.
-ESLint W/ Typescript    : as defined in our tsconfig.json, to maintain code quality and standards throughout the framework
